Description:
  Rapidity distributions are presented for events containing a Z boson or a 
  photon in association with a single jet produced at the CERN Large Hadron 
  Collider. The data are from proton-proton collisions collected with the CMS 
  detector, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5/fb at 
  sqrt(s)=7 TeV. In the laboratory reference frame,  the rapidities of Z 
  bosons and direct photons and of their accompanying jet are consistent within 
  5% with expectations from QCD. Nevertheless, significant differences are 
  found in the center-of-momentum frame of the two final-state objects between 
  the data and predictions from next-to-leading order perturbative QCD 
  calculations, as well as between two Monte Carlo generators that merge 
  matrix-elements and parton showers using alternative methods.
