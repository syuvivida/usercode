Description:
Rapidity distributions are presented for events containing either a 
Z boson or a photon in association with a single jet in proton-proton 
collisions produced at the CERN LHC. The data, collected with the CMS
detector at sqrt(s)=7 TeV, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.0/fb. 
The individual rapidity distributions of the boson and the jet are 
consistent within 5% with expectations from perturbative QCD. However,
QCD predictions for the sum and the difference in rapidities of the two
final-state objects show significant discrepancies with CMS data. In
particular, next-to-leading-order QCD calculations, and two Monte Carlo
event generators using different methods to merge matrix-element
partons with evolved parton showers, appear inconsistent with the data
as well as with each other.
