1) Note, because all the batch jobs will be run in the same directory, 
 you need to make sure the output root files have different 
 names for each job segment.

2) Prepare two shell script as loopLHE.bash and runJob.csh

loopLHE.bash includes information of the job queue, number of jobs, input 
arguments that varies with the job segment number

runJob.csh includes the environment setup before running job and also 
the working directory. 

Note, if you are not using CMSSW, the following line is not required. 
setenv SCRAM_ARCH slc5_amd64_gcc462; eval `scramv1 runtime -csh`

If your job requires special environment settings, such as LHAPDF setting, 
you need to include it in runJob.csh

loopLHE.bash calls runJob.csh

3) to submit job, run ./loopLHE.bash

4) More information about the job queue is here:
